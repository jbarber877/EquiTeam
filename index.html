							<h2>Energy Access for All</h2>
							<p>Universal access to modern energy services by 2030. Currently, many people, especially in developing regions, still rely on traditional biomass (e.g., wood, charcoal) for cooking and heating, which can be inefficient and harmful to health. The goal is to ensure that everyone has access to clean and modern forms of energy, like electricity and clean cooking technologies.</p>
							<p>Ensuring energy access for all starts by eliminating waste at home. Find out how much you can save using our energy savings calculator at the link below.</p>
